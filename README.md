# Building for development

```sh
$ just setup debug

# This command:
# 1. always re-builds rust SO
# 2. conditionally re-compiles C files if there are changes
# 3. always re-links final binary (because of the change to SO)
# 4. launches binary
$ just dev
```

`compile_commands.json` is automatically generated by Meson, so make sure to pass `--compile-commands-dir=builddir` to `clangd`.

# Building for packaging

```sh
$ meson setup builddir --buildtype=release --prefix=$PWD/installation-dir
$ meson compile -C builddir
